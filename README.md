Solutions of the Fetch Rewards Take Home Test



First: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
Refer to the file: Final ER Diagram.png

Second: Write a query that directly answers a predetermined question from a business stakeholder
Refer to the file: SQL Queries.pdf


Third: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
Refer to files: Data Quality Issues Receipts.ipynb, Data Quality Issues Users.ipynb, and Data Quality Issues Brands.ipynb

Major data quality issues were found with the 'Receipts' data(Receipts.ipynb).
